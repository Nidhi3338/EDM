 Due to the TVOM, we prefer to receive a fixed sum of money sooner rather than
later; likewise, we prefer to pay a fixed sum of money later, rather than sooner.
discounted cash flow rules (DCF)/ TVOM
-- I. Money has a time value.(present value and discount rate and unit time )
-- II. Quantities of money cannot be added or

points in time.
-- III. To move money forward one time unit,
multiply by 1 plus the discount or interest
rate.
-- IV. To move money backward one time unit,
divide by 1 plus the discount or interest rate
